# fp

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Building

Run `nx build fp` to build the library.


## Documentation

This module provides two main types: `Option` and `Result`, which are useful for handling optional values and error cases in a functional programming style.

### Option

The `Option` type represents an optional value. It can be either `Some` containing a value, or `None` representing the absence of a value.

### Result

The `Result` type represents the outcome of an operation that might fail. It can be either `Success` containing a value, or `ResError` containing an error.

## Usefulness in Functional Programming and Pipeline-Oriented Programming

These types are particularly valuable in functional programming (FP) and pipeline-oriented programming for several reasons:

1. **Explicit Error Handling**: `Option` and `Result` types make error handling explicit in the type system. This encourages developers to consider and handle edge cases, leading to more robust code.

2. **Composition**: These types can be easily composed and chained in functional pipelines. For example, you can chain multiple operations that return `Option` or `Result` types, handling success and failure cases elegantly.

3. **Avoiding Null/Undefined**: By using `Option`, you can avoid null or undefined values, which are common sources of runtime errors. This leads to safer, more predictable code.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: `Result` type separates the success path from the error path, allowing you to process them independently. This separation often leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

5. **Declarative Style**: These types promote a more declarative programming style, where you describe what you want to happen in different scenarios (Some/None, Success/Error) rather than imperatively handling each case.

6. **Improved Readability**: By using these types, the intent of the code becomes clearer. It's immediately obvious when a function might not return a value or might fail.

7. **Pattern Matching**: These types work well with pattern matching, a powerful feature in many functional programming languages, allowing for concise and expressive code.

By leveraging `Option` and `Result` types, you can create more robust, composable, and expressive code, aligning well with the principles of functional and pipeline-oriented programming.
